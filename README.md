# Todo

[ ] Merge Query into ExecuteQuery  
[ ] Merge firebase data with model data? or keep the 2 separate?  
[ ] Reintroduce the model data?  
[ ] Make apiActionCreator usable with any api and expose it! (maybe that will go well with the model data?)  
[ ] Consider rollup for building  
[ ] Add docs  
[ ] Add examples  
[ ] Check for PWA  

# Components to implement

[ ] Repeat  
[ ] Control (= wrapInSelectors)  
[ ] UiControl (simpler for pure UI components)  
[ ] Page + routing  
[ ]   

# Selectors to implement

[ ] firebaseState  
[ ] appState  
[ ] substr  
[ ] expr  
[ ]   
[ ]   

# firebase

[ ] reactive queries  
[ ] messaging  
[ ] simulate push  

# Modules
